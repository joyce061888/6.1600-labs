Question 1:

A) AES-128-GMAC is the better choice for encrypting >1MB
files. HMAC-SHA256 is a hash based authentification that 
provides data integrity and authentification but does not 
provide confidentiality through encryption. AES-128-GMAC
is an autheticated encryption scheme that provides confidentiality
via encryption and data integrity and authentification. 

B) It will take roughly 2 times more time to encrypt a 100 MB
file after increase the key size by two times, with the assumption that 
there's a linear relationship between key size and encryption time.
??? but why

C) RSA - 3072 bit key, DSA - 3072 bit key, ECDSA - 256 bit key

i) ECDSA is the fastest for signing because of the shorter key length.
DSA is the slowest for signing because it has fixed key sizes.

ii)

iii)

iv)

D)
