Question 1:

A) AES-128-GMAC is the better choice for encrypting >1MB
files. HMAC-SHA256 is a hash based authentification that 
provides data integrity and authentification but does not 
provide confidentiality through encryption. AES-128-GMAC
is an autheticated encryption scheme that provides confidentiality
via encryption and data integrity and authentification. 

B) It will take roughly 2 times more time to encrypt a 100 MB
file after increase the key size by two times, with the assumption that 
there's a linear relationship between key size and encryption time.
??? but why

C) 

i) RSA - 3072 bit key, DSA - 3072 bit key, ECDSA - 256 bit key

ii) ECDSA is the fastest for signing because of the shorter key length and elliptic
curve cryptography. DSA is the slowest for signing because it has fixed key sizes and thus its less
flexible balance between security and performance, and because of its complex mod arithmetic.

iii) ECDSA is the fastest for signature verification and DSA is the slowest
with similar reasons provided in part (i). 

iv) ECDSA has the fastest keypair generation and DSA has the slowest.

D) I would use bcrypt because it has automatic salting and the algorithm
itself is also computationally costly to brute force attack. Bcrypt is also 
adaptive in that even if hardware becomes more powerful over time, the algorithm can be 
made slower by a "work factor" that the algorithm can adjust to determine the computation cost.
